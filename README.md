# Airnominal

An open platform for collection and collaborative sharing of air quality data.

## About

The problem of air pollution is one of the most acutely dangerous ecological problems we face today. According to studies made by World Health Organization, almost all of the global population breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of pollutants. Even though sensors and other measurement equipment is already available, data that researchers use usually comes from two to three stations in an area, and large datasets of high spatial resolution are not available. To test if any solution addressing air quality is effective, researchers need to be able to obtain many higher quality data in a standardized format.

To address this problem, we built an open platform of air quality measuring stations that enables people to connect and exchange air quality measurements and design an open measuring station that anyone can build and connect to the platform, thus providing valuable information for the research and limiting of the main causes of high PM particles concentration.

The platform is publicly deployed at [`zrak.gimvic.org`](https://zrak.gimvic.org).
